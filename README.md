# Basic-Python-Examples

These are some of the first Python programs I have created. I understand that they are far from perfect and any pointers and improvments are greatly appreciated.

ILS Glide Slope Claculator.py - Enter in the ILS (Instrument Landing System) glide slope and your desired ground speed. The program will output a rate of decent in ft/min. It will also round up the rate of decent to the nearest 50 and then display a new ground speed that will ensure the aircraft stays on the glide slope entered. (This tool is for reference only)
